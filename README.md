Some batchfiles are equipped with GUI, suitable as templates for editing.
Most useful are:  

- **dir OPTIVORBIS ogg** - recompress all .ogg within dir and subdirs, using OPTIVORBIS; saves up to 10% of .ogg size.  

- **dir LibreOffice rtf2docx** - batch convertion of .rtf, .doc,  .odt and .fb2 files to .docx using LibreOffice. Overcomes clumsy LibreOffice idea of exporting all files into one dir.  

- **dir AdvZIP docx** - recompressing .docx after *dir LibreOffice rtf2docx* gives up to 10% space saving.  

- **dir RENAME unflibusta** - batch renaming of files according to patterns, like replacing underscores with spaces, removing digits, and so on. Edit rules pattern to your need.
