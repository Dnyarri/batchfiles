Some batchfiles with GUI, suitable as templates for editing.
Most useful are:
- **dir OPTIVORBIS ogg** - recompress all .ogg within dir and subdirs, using OPTIVORBIS; saves up to 10% of .ogg size.
- **dir LibreOffice rtf2docx** - batch convertion of .rtf, .doc and .odt files to .docx using LibreOffice. Overcomes clumsy LibreOffice idea of exporting all files into one dir.
- **dir AdvZIP docx** - recompressing .docx after *dir LibreOffice rtf2docx* gives up to 10% space saving.
