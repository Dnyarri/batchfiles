Some batchfiles with GUI, suitable as templates for editing.
Most useful are:
- **readdir OPTIVORBIS ogg** - recompressing .ogg using OPTIVORBIS; saves up to 10% of .ogg size
- **dir LibreOffice rtf2docx** - batch converting of rtf to docx using LibreOffice. Overcomes clumsy LibreOffice idea of exporting all files into one dir.
